**Type safe Kubernetes middleware for humans**

Pepr simplifies Kubernetes management by providing an alternative to complex YAML configurations, custom scripts, and ad-hoc solutions. As a Kubernetes controller, Pepr enables you to define Kubernetes transformations using TypeScript, accessible through straightforward configurations even without extensive development expertise.

## What happened to Pepr's stars?

In February 2025, an accidental change to the repository's visibility reset the star count.
The visibility issue was quickly resolved, but the stars were unfortunately lost.

Pepr had over 200 stars, demonstrating its recognition and value within the Kubernetes community.
We're working to rebuild that recognition.

If you've previously starred Pepr, or if you find it a useful project, we would greatly appreciate it if you could re-star the repository.
We really appreciate your support! ‚≠ê

## Example Pepr Action

This quick sample shows how to react to a ConfigMap being created or updated in the cluster.
For more details see the [actions](./user-guide/actions/) section.

```ts
When(a.ConfigMap)
  .IsCreatedOrUpdated()
  .InNamespace("pepr-demo")
  .WithLabel("example", "value")
  // Create a Mutate Action for the ConfigMap
  .Mutate(request => {
    // Add a label and annotation to the ConfigMap
    request.SetLabel("pepr", "was-here").SetAnnotation("pepr.dev", "annotations-work-too");

    // Add some data to the ConfigMap
    request.Raw.data["doug-says"] = "Pepr is awesome!";

    // Log a message to the Pepr controller logs
    Log.info("A ConfigMap was created or updated:");
  })
  // Create a Validate Action for the ConfigMap
  .Validate(request => {
    // Validate the ConfigMap has a specific label
    if (request.HasLabel("pepr")) {
      return request.Approve();
    }

    // Reject the ConfigMap if it doesn't have the label
    return request.Deny("ConfigMap must have the required pepr label");
  });
```

## Quick Start Guide

```bash
# Create a new Pepr Module
npx pepr init

# If you already have a K3d cluster you want to use, skip this step
npm run k3d-setup

# Start playing with Pepr now!
npx pepr dev
kubectl apply -f capabilities/hello-pepr.samples.yaml
```
